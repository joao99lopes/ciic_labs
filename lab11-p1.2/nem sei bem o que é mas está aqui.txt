Antecedents (Inputs)

    amount of lights on
        Universe (ie, crisp value range): How many lights are on, from 0 to 3?
        4Fuzzy set (ie, fuzzy value range): 0, 1, 2, 3
   
    CO2 increase rate
        Universe: How much has the CO2 level increased, on a scale os -1 to 1?
        Fuzzy set: decrease fast, decrease, stable, increase, increase fast
    daytime
        Universe: What time of the day is it, from 0 to 24?
        Fuzzy set: day, night
    weather
        Universe: What value is captured by 'S3Light' (light sensor that gets more light) from 0 to 500?
        Fuzzy set: cloudy, sunny
Consequents (Outputs)
    amount of persons in the room
        Universe: Is the room overcrowded?
        Fuzzy set: not overcrowded, overcrowded
Rules
    IF there are 3 lights on, THEN the room is overcrowded.
    IF there are less than 3 lights on and it's nightime, THEN the room is not overcrowded.
    IF there are less than 3 lights on and it's daytime and the CO2 variation is stable, THEN the room is not overcrowded.

Usage
    If I tell this controller that:
        the number of lights on is [!!!!!], and
        the daytime is [!!!!!], and
        the CO2 variation is [!!!!!],
    it would say that the room is:
        [!!!!!]
